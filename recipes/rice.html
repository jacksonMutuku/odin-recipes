    <p>
        Cooking times may vary depending on the type of rice used, so it's always a good idea to check the package instructions for specific guidelines.

    <ul>
        <li>1 cup of rice</li>
        <li>2 cups of water</li>
        <li>Salt (optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <ol>
        <li>Rinse the rice: Place the rice in a fine-mesh strainer and rinse it under cold water until the water runs clear. This helps remove excess starch and improve the texture of the cooked rice.</li>
        <li>Measure the water: For every cup of rice, use two cups of water. This ratio works for most types of rice, but you can adjust the water quantity depending on your preference or the specific type of rice you're using.</li>
        <li>Combine rice and water: In a medium-sized saucepan, add the rinsed rice and water. If desired, add a pinch of salt to enhance the flavor. Give it a gentle stir to distribute the rice evenly.</li>
        <li>Bring to a boil: Place the saucepan on the stovetop over medium-high heat. Allow the water to come to a rolling boil. This may take a few minutes.</li>
        <li>Reduce heat and cover: Once the water is boiling, reduce the heat to low and cover the saucepan with a tight-fitting lid. Let the rice simmer for about 15-20 minutes. Avoid lifting the lid during this time as it will release steam and affect the cooking process.</li>
        <li>Check for doneness: After 15-20 minutes, remove the saucepan from the heat. Let the rice sit, covered, for an additional 5 minutes. This allows the rice to steam and become fully cooked. After 5 minutes, uncover the saucepan and fluff the rice gently with a fork. The rice should be tender and each grain should be separate.</li>
        <li>Serve and enjoy: Your rice is now ready to be served as a side dish or as a base for various recipes. Enjoy!</li>
